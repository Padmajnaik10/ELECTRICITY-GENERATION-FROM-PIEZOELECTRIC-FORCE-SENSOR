# ELECTRICITY-GENERATION-FROM-PIEZOELECTRIC-FORCE-SENSOR
In this mini-Project we will generate electricity from piezoelectric sensor by using the phenomenon of PIEZOELECTRIC EFFECT. Piezoelectric Effect is the ability of certain materials to generate an electric charge in response to applied mechanical stress. The piezoelectric crystals exhibit the piezoelectric effect
